title: "AI Dance Feedback App"
---
## Overview
This project explores an AI-based training system that analyzes dance fundamentals and provides real-time feedback using pose estimation and motion analysis.

## Key Features
- Real-time pose estimation using MoveNet / MediaPipe
- Detection of fundamental dance techniques (posture, alignment, timing)
- Automated feedback with correction suggestions
- Data visualization and movement tracking

## Skills & Tools
- Python, Google Colab
- MediaPipe Pose, OpenCV for motion analysis
- NumPy, Matplotlib for visualization
- Figma for UX design


## Research Goal
To design a system that supports dancers by visualizing performance accuracy and proposing corrections in an easy-to-understand format.
