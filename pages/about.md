## Hello — I’m Hee Seon Choi

I’m an **AI undergraduate and dancer** building an app for **real-time feedback on dance fundamentals**—posture, alignment, and movement quality.

### Direction
The goal is simple: make practice clear and actionable. I’m prototyping a pipeline that estimates poses, quantifies core metrics, and delivers **concise corrections** during practice. Early experiments run frame-wise in Colab; I’m now evolving them into a **real-time** feedback loop.

### What I’m building
- **Joint-angle first**: precise per-frame angles of the **knee, shoulder, and elbow**
- **Basic symmetry**: left–right comparison for knees and shoulders
- **Confidence gating**: ignore low-confidence keypoints to avoid noisy feedback

### Tech Stack
- Python (Colab)
- TensorFlow/TF Hub (MoveNet)
- OpenCV
- NumPy/Matplotlib
- Figma
